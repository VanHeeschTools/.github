# VanHeeschTools

Welcome to the **VanHeeschTools** GitHub organization! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

 This repository hosts bioinformatics tools and pipelines from the [Van Heesch group](https://research.prinsesmaximacentrum.nl/en/research-groups/van-heesch-group). We specialize in multi-omics integration, including RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, proteomics and immunopeptidomics. Our main research focus is the role of a new group of small proteins, also called ‚Äúmicro-proteins‚Äù, in childhood cancer. Particularly focusing on its high tumor specificity for therapeutic applications.
